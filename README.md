# 🎵 Hindi Music Recommendation System

A web-based music recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest similar Hindi songs based on musical features like tempo, energy, danceability, and valence.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Uses K-Means clustering and cosine similarity
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design with search suggestions  
- **Real-time Search**: Autocomplete functionality with instant suggestions
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, animations, and user-friendly messages
- **Dataset Analytics**: Shows clustering information and dataset statistics

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- All required Python packages (automatically installed)

### 2. Installation

The project uses a virtual environment that's already configured. All packages are installed automatically.

### 3. Running the Application

**Option 1: Run the Web Application (Recommended)**
```bash
python app.py
```
Then open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

**Option 2: Run the Original Script**
